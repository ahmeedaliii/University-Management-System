# University Management System
## Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive data management system for a university, utilizing various technologies such as SQL, PLSQL, Advanced PLSQL, Red Hat, Bash scripting, Java SE, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project covers database design, SQL and PLSQL implementation, automation scripts, Java application development, and integration.

## Milestones
1. Database Design 
- Define a relational database schema with tables for students, courses, departments, and grades.
- Normalize the schema to ensure data integrity.
- Document the database design.
2. SQL Implementation 
- Create SQL scripts to build the database schema.
- Populate the database with sample data.
- Test and validate the correctness of the database.
3. PLSQL Implementation 
- Write PLSQL procedures for:
- Updating student information.
- Calculating GPA.
- Test the PLSQL procedures with sample data.
4. Automation Scripts 
- Bash script for database backup.
- Bash script for monitoring disk space and sending alerts.
- Schedule a script to check for anomalies and send notifications.
5. Java Application Development 
- Develop Java classes for Student, Course, and Department using OOP principles.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the Java application.
- Integrate the Java application with the SQL database.
- Test the application with various scenarios.
6. Integration and Reporting 
- Implement a feature in the Java application to generate a report.
- The report should display a list of courses, enrolled students, and average GPA for each course.
- Ensure seamless integration between the Java application and the database.
- Prepare the presentation for the project.
